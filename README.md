# Server Side Calculator

## Description

A basic calculator that handles all calculation logic on a server. Client-side, inputs are accepted (two numbers and an operator). On clicking the equals sign, this data is sent to the server, which returns not only the most recent result but also the history of all calculations that have been made so far. The client script renders this history on the page, along with prominently displaying the most recent result. A "C" button is available to clear inputs at any time.
